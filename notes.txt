CNF transformation:
 +Start with the naive version from "Computing small clause normal forms" without miniscoping
 +Then create the standard version by adding miniscoping and formula renaming
 +Then create the advanced version by adding advanced skolemization 
 +Keep all three available and have a command line switch to choose between them

Random notes:
 +Should we use pure equational representation?
 +The equational representation of a non-equational atom A is the equation A = T, where T is a special function symbol signifying truth.
